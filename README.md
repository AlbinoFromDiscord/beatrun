# Beatrun | Community version

Infamous parkour addon for Garry's Mod, fully open sourced and maintained by the community.

This version does not include malicious modules, code or networking. What it does contain is:
* Lua modules for Discord Rich Presence
* Lua modules for Steam Presence
* Network connectivity for courses (activates only when you load or upload courses, and by default `courses.beatrun.ru` is used)

**All of this is optional and you may remove all of it. (modules are located [here](https://github.com/JonnyBro/beatrun/blob/master/lua/bin/) and online courses functionality is [here](https://github.com/JonnyBro/beatrun/blob/master/beatrun/gamemodes/beatrun/gamemode/cl/OnlineCourse.lua))**
