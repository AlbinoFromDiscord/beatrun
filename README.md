# beatrun
Modified beatrun's source code.<br><br>
There are lua modules ([source](https://github.com/fluffy-servers/gmod-discord-rpc)), they are for Discord Rich Presence to work, if you want pure Lua just don't extract them, but your Level and Map will not be shown in your Discord status.<br>
This version of the beatrun works on any version of the game (Chromium or not).

# Installation
