# beatrun
Modified beatrun's source code.<br><br>
There are lua modules, they are for Discord Rich Presence to work, if you want pure Lua just don't extract them, but your Level and Map will not be shown in your Discord status.<br>
This version of the beatrun works on any version of the game (Chromium or not).

[Old Kick Glitch Version](https://github.com/JonnyBro/beatrun/tree/old-kickglitch)

# Installation
0. Delete `beatrun` folder in *addons* if you have it!
1. Extract `beatrun` folder to *your_game_folder/garrysmod/addons*.
2. Extract `lua` folder to *your_game_folder/garrysmod*.
    * `lua` folder constains modules for Discord Rich Presense to work. They are open source, visit [this](https://github.com/fluffy-servers/gmod-discord-rpc) to see the source.

## Changes added by me
* [Custom online courses database](https://courses.beatrun.ru)! It's free ðŸ¤¯!
* Allow Overdrive usage on the server - `Beatrun_AllowOvedriveInMultiplayer`.
* Change HUD's colors - `Beatrun_HUDTextColor`, `Beatrun_HUDCornerColor`, `Beatrun_HUDFloatingXPColor`.
* Discord Rich Presence (extract `lua` folder to `garrysmod`, along side with `addons` folder).
* Small camera punch when diving.
* Change max moving speed - `Beatrun_MaxSpeed`.
* Ability to remove ziplines that created with *Zipline Gun* - RMB.
* Removed your SteamID from right corner, because I can.
* Allow players to spawn props without admin rights - `Beatrun_AllowPropSpawn`.
