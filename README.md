# Beatrun
Modified Beatrun's source code.<br><br>
There are lua modules, they are for Discord Rich Presence and Steam Presence to work, if you want pure Lua just don't extract them, but your Level and Map will not be shown in your Discord and Steam statuses.<br><br>
This version should works on any version of the game (Base version is known good, Chromium has some issues and I don't have time to fix them).

## Animations
You can use *Beatrun Animations Installer* if you want to change your animations, there are new ones (from Beatrun Reanimated project) and OG (but fixed) ones, OG is default.<br>
Installer source can be found [here](/BeatrunAnimInstaller/)

# Installation
> Beatrun shouldn't conflict with Workshop VManip, but if it does, delete or disable it.<br>
1. **Delete `beatrun` folder in *addons* if you have one!**
2. Extract `beatrun` folder to *your_game_folder/garrysmod/addons*.
3. Extract `lua` folder to *your_game_folder/garrysmod*.
	* `lua` folder constains modules for Discord Rich Presense and Steam Presence to work. They are open source, visit [this](https://github.com/fluffy-servers/gmod-discord-rpc) to see the sources of DRP and [this](https://github.com/YuRaNnNzZZ/gmcl_steamrichpresencer) for SP.
