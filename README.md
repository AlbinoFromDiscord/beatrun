# Beatrun
Modified Beatrun's source code.<br><br>
There are some Lua modules, they are for Discord Rich Presence and Steam Presence to work.<br>
If you want pure Lua just don't extract them, but your Level and Map will not be shown in your Discord and Steam statuses.<br><br>
This version should works on any version of the game (Base version is known good, x64 has some issues and I'm trying to fix them when I can).

## Animations
You can use **Beatrun Animations Installer** if you want to change your animations, there are new ones (from Beatrun Reanimated project) and OG (but fixed) ones, OG is default.<br>
Just start the exe and press a key on your keyboard with the number of the animations you want to install (If it doesn't change animations, run installer as admin).<br>
Installer source can be found [here](/BeatrunAnimInstaller/)

# Installation
0. Download this repository [here](https://github.com/JonnyBro/beatrun/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) (should be always up-to-date).

2. Extract `beatrun` folder to *your_game_folder/garrysmod/addons*.
