# beatrun
Modified beatrun's source code.<br><br>
There are lua modules, they are for Discord Rich Presence and Steam Presence to work, if you want pure Lua just don't extract them, but your Level and Map will not be shown in your Discord and Steam statuses.<br>
This version should works on any version of the game (Base version is known good, Chromium has some issues and I don't have time to fix them).

# Installation
1. **Delete or disable VManip (Base) that downloaded from Workshop!**
2. **Delete `beatrun` and `vmaniprework` folders in *addons* if you have one!**
3. Extract `beatrun` and `vmaniprework` folders to *your_game_folder/garrysmod/addons*.
4. Extract `lua` folder to *your_game_folder/garrysmod*.
	* `lua` folder constains modules for Discord Rich Presense and Steam Presence to work. They are open source, visit [this](https://github.com/fluffy-servers/gmod-discord-rpc) to see the sources of DRP and [this](https://github.com/YuRaNnNzZZ/gmcl_steamrichpresencer) for SP.
